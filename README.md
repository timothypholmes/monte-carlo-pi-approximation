### The Theory

The area of a circle is given by 

/begin{equation}
/pi r^{2}
/end{equation}

The number of points that are generated inside the circle divided by the total number of generated points multiplied by 4 will give us our approximation of $/pi$. Thus, we have 

/begin{equation}
/pi /approx 4/frac{N_{inner}}{N_total}}
/end{equation}
